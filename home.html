    <h3>If you knew you couldn't fail, what would you do?</h3>
    <p>
        Developing my own video game has always been a dream, and I envision creating a 2.5D platformer that blends precision platforming with innovative combat mechanics. Inspired by the intense challenge of games like Celeste and Super Meat Boy, my goal is to craft a game that pushes players' skills to the limit while also introducing unique ways to engage in combat. By utilizing the 3D depth within a 2.5D space, I aim to create dynamic fights that break the traditional side-scrolling mold, allowing for creative movement and attack strategies that feel fresh and rewarding.
